This was an attempt to extract an itemized list of groceries using computer vision capabilities.
The goal: visibility on expenses, summarizing expense list with the aim of optimizing life. Balancing necessities and indulgences.

Challenges faced in phase 1:

1) Receipts must be clear images and flattened, requires additional work to take photos with that kind of clarity

2) Receipts must be printed with high contrast ink, light ink makes it hard for the text extraction to happen
    This poses problems for receipt extraction, but provided consideration to extract this information earlier in the
    process.

3) Markings and practices at stores can make the receipt capture process a time crucial process. For example,
    the Costco receipt used to extract has markings on it as part of the process in leaving the store.

Conclusion: The receipts physical aspects offer risk. The physical receipt is a barrier and hurdle. Digital receipts are available and could be used. The problem I aim to solve is greater granularity in expenses. Today's work reveals an easier access point for this information. Since
the receipt is already itemized and digitized, then this information could be passed to users without the need for a physical receipt.

Next steps:

1) Understand how this problem is being handled right now
2) Reach out to the companies responsible for "checkout" technology, see if they're interested in brainstorming
3) Find additonal text extraction models to work with
4) Generate summaries on recipets used and document specific issues between the image and extracted text
